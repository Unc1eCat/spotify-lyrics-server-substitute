Required headers:
1. "Authorization" must always be set to "Bearer".
2. "Client-Token" must contain auth token of the client.
3. "App-Platform" supposedly contains code name telling whether web player, desktop client, mobile app, etc. was used to send the requests. Didn't find anything to work here except "WebPlayer".
Other headers haven't been observed to be mandatory.
