Web spotify. While playing Ожоги бульвара a response to https://spclient.wg.spotify.com/color-lyrics/v2/track/4WgaV9uCevvqvwW8cQjFho/image/https%3A%2F%2Fi.scdn.co%2Fimage%2Fab67616d0000b273001e2a49e2ab67039d634495?format=json&vocalRemoval=false&market=from_token

Required headers:
1. "Authorization" must always be set to "Bearer".
2. "Client-Token" must contain auth token of the client.
3. "App-Platform" supposedly contains code name telling whether web player, desktop client, mobile app, etc. was used to send the requests. Didn't find anything to work here except "WebPlayer".
Other headers haven't been observed to be mandatory.

The color in the response JSON is an aRGB value encoded as a 4 bytes signed integer. To get the integer from the four components of aRGB (0 - 255 each), 
convert each of them to bytes of length 1 and then concatenate them into a 4 byte value in order alpha, red, green, blue. The resulting 4 byte value is 
converted to the signed integer (big endian).
